        <h2> A Little More Data If You Please</h2>
        
        <p>
          A saw a line of code fly  accross the console, and the  output that followed. I was captivated by this digital prose. I knew this was a pen that I would have to wield. And to share my ink with fellow scribes accross all global divides. Too colaberate and cofacilitate a thous=and variences of scene open and a million myrid more flavors for scene close.  Shakespere in any other language; is it not just as sweet?

          As the world is warmed by a yellow sun so is mine warmed by my Son. He is my passion and my reason for being. He has inspired me and rekindled my first love; the writen word. I have promiced to him a story worth reading. A story and a journey told in equal parts word and code.  I look forward to mingling the passions in every chapter to come; to embrace any, and all new writing adventures.
