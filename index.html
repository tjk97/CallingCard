          A saw a line of code fly   accross the console, and then the  resulting output that followed. I became captivated by this digital prose. I knew this was a pen that I would have to wield. And to share my ink with other scribers accross all global divides. Too colaberate and cofacilitate a thousand variences of scene open and a million myrid more flavors for scene close.  Shakespere in any other language not as sweet?

          As the world is warmed by thesun so is mine warmed by my son. He is my passion and my reason for being. He has inspired and rekindled my first love; the writen word. And, I have promiced to him a story worth reading. A story and journey told in equal parts word and code.  I look forward to mingling the passions in every chapter to come.  Feel free to contact me.  I look forward to many new writing adventures.
